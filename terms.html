                    You agree that by accessing the Services, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all
                    of these Legal Terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE LEGAL TERMS, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY
                    PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SERVICES AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.

                <p>
                    Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Services from time to time
                    are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion,
                    to make changes or modifications to these Legal Terms from time to time. We will alert you about any
                    changes by updating the &#39;Last updated&#39; date of these Legal Terms, and you waive any right to
                    receive specific notice of each such change. It is your responsibility to periodically review these

                    made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Legal Terms by your continued use of
                    the Services after the date such revised Legal Terms are posted.

                <p>
                    The Services are intended for users who are at least 18 years old. Persons under the age of 13 are
                    not permitted to use or register for the Services.
                </p>
                <p>We recommend that you print a copy of these Legal Terms for your records.</p>
                <p><strong>1. OUR SERVICES</strong></p>
                <p>
                    The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any
                    person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to
                    law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction
                    or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services from other locations do so
                    on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the
                    extent local laws are applicable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance
                    Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA),
                    etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use the Services. You
                    may not use the Services in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).

                    The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties
                    individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other
                    proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action
                    basis or to utilise class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute
                    to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other

                <p>
                    The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning

                    concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute
                    related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorised use;
                    and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable,
                    then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision
                    found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent
                    jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the
                    personal jurisdiction of that court.

                <p>
                    These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Services or in respect to
                    the Services constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to
                    exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms shall not operate as a waiver of
                    such right or provision. These Legal Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may
                    assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible
                    or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable
                    control. If any provision or part of a provision of these Legal Terms is determined to be unlawful,
                    void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Legal
                    Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no
                    joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship created between you and us as a result
                    of these Legal Terms or use of the Services. You agree that these Legal Terms will not be construed
                    against us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defences you may have
                    based on the electronic form of these Legal Terms and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to
                    execute these Legal Terms.
